# Emotion Detection using Live Camera with OpenCV and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates real-time emotion detection using a webcam feed with OpenCV and a pre-trained machine learning model. The application captures video from the webcam, processes each frame to detect faces, and predicts the emotion of each detected face.


Introduction
This project uses OpenCV for video capture and face detection, and a pre-trained machine learning model to predict emotions in real-time. The goal is to create an interactive application that can identify and display emotions from faces seen by the webcam.

Features
Real-time video capture from webcam.
Face detection using OpenCV.
Emotion prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model.
Display of detected faces with emotion labels.

Model
The project uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a facial expression dataset (e.g., FER-2013). The model can detect the following emotions:

Happy
Sad
Angry
Surprised
Neutral
Fearful
Disgusted
